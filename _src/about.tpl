                          <p>Here at Delta Tau Delta, we recognize that we’re here at MIT to, first and foremost, learn and grow. Our academics are of high importance and we’re proud to harbor highly talented and intelligent brothers who go on to become the greatest they can be. With brothers who span across 12 different majors, Delta Tau Delta is a diverse group of intellects that know how to take their work seriously.</p>

                          <p>Over the years, brothers and alumni of Delta Tau Delta have always supported each other in their coursework. A library of course content, notes, and texts have been accumulated over the decades. These allow every brother a glimpse into how past brothers have succeeded academically during their time here at MIT. Our Course Library also contains the schedules of past brothers and suggestions by graduated seniors who would like to pass on their own personal skills to all present and future brothers. </p>

                          <p>Brothers who know their course materials inside and out, are elected to provide an academic support system for underclassmen. This ensures that each brother has the resources necessary to fully understand their courses. Brothers are held to high academic standards, and are encouraged to take full advantage of the expertise of upperclassmen who have recently completed similar coursework.</p>

                          <p>These are our largest parties, which attract students from MIT, BU, Northeastern, Wellesley, Tufts, and several others. Each party has a theme that makes for a great time. Beach party, Toga, Grog, Graveyard, and Goldfish are some of the best parties in Boston. Don’t just take our word for it - ask around and you’ll hear stories. These parties are where true college memories are created. Dress to theme and don’t miss out.</p>

                          <p>This is where we get fancy. Once in a while we host an invite-only cocktail party on our beautiful roof deck. They are more relaxing and quaint than the bigger parties, but debatably more fun. We hire a live Berklee jazz band to truly set the mood. Shirt and tie are mandatory for guys, and dresses mandatory for girls.</p>

                          <p>Mixers are smaller parties with a single sorority. Delts have great relationships with sororities from MIT and other schools throughout Boston. To keep these relations up, we host a variety of sorority mixers each semester, each with a different feel, set-up, and theme. We use mixers to get to know the girls more personally.</p>

                          <p>Formal is another place where we get fancy. Once a semester, we spare no expense on Formal. Examples of past Formals are harbor cruises, dinners at the Top of the Hub, Blue Man Group outings, comedy club shows, and private dinners in the North End. Usually the night continues with ice-skating on frog pond or dessert at the Cheesecake Factory.</p>
