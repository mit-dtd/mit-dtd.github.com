        <p>Rush is just around the corner, and we couldn't be more excited to meet the future brothers of Delta Tau Delta. We've got a great rush schedule planned, including jet skiing, indoor skydiving, and paintball. </p>
        <p>We are looking for brothers who are smart, hard-working, confident, and driven. In addition to these things, we are looking for brothers who want more out of MIT than just a great education.</p>
        <p>Delts offers its brothers important friendships, a bustling social life, and a true chance to grow as a person. Delts enjoy one of the closest-knit brotherhoods known to any college campus, and any Delt will tell you how much he values the friendships and connections he's made here. </p>
        <p>If you have any questions about Delta Tau Delta or about rush, please contact me at:</p><p> <a href="mailto:andrew16@mit.edu">andrew16@mit.edu </a> or <b>(630) 800-8417</b>.</p>
        <p>If you think you may be a good fit, we would love to see you at our rush events.
        My brothers and I look forward to meeting you.  </p>
        <p><em>Andrew Hochstadt, Rush Chairman</em></p>
