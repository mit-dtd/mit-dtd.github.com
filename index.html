        <p>Welcome to Delta Tau Delta at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Since our founding in 1889 the Beta Nu chapter has been a leader on campus and our brothers have gone on to be leaders around the world.</p>
        <p>At 416 Beacon Street you will find a beautiful, spacious brownstone filled with a diverse group of 34 driven brothers. Delts hail from New York to California, Texas to Minnesota, Florida to Alaska. Brothers represent over 15 different majors and participate in a variety of sports and clubs. Our house boasts a roofdeck, study room, library, music room, workout room, six-car garage, laundry facilities, 72" HDTV, HD DirectTV, pool table, piano, 20TB server, and Ken Koga, our personal chef.</p>
        <p>We live by the motto "Work hard, play hard". Work hard, because we excel in academics, leadership, and service to others. Brothers are committed to academic success and take on leadership roles on campus. Play hard, because we understand that there is more to life than classes and problem sets. Our social events include both large and small parties, mixers with sororities, fancy cocktail parties, and a formal.</p>
        <p>The Delt shelter is a place to study and learn, a place to laugh and party, a place to call home. The bonds of brotherhood fostered here last a lifetime.</p>
        <p>I invite you to explore our website and learn more about our chapter.</p>

A library of course content, notes, and texts have been accumulated over the decades. These allow every brother a glimpse into how past brothers have succeeded academically during their time here at MIT. Our Course Library also contains the schedules of past brothers and suggestions by graduated seniors who would like to pass on their own personal skills to all present and future brothers. </p>

Don’t just take our word for it - ask around and you’ll hear stories. These parties are where true college memories are created. Dress to theme and don’t miss out.</p>

                          <p>This is where we get fancy. Once in a while we host an invite-only cocktail party on our beautiful roof deck. They are more relaxing and quaint than the bigger parties, but debatably more fun. We hire a live Berklee jazz band to truly set the mood. Shirt and tie are mandatory for guys, and dresses mandatory for girls.</p>

                          <p>Mixers are smaller parties with a single sorority. Delts have great relationships with sororities from MIT and other schools throughout Boston. To keep these relations up, we host a variety of sorority mixers each semester, each with a different feel, set-up, and theme. We use mixers to get to know the girls more personally.</p>

                          <p>Formal is another place where we get fancy. Once a semester, we spare no expense on Formal. Examples of past Formals are harbor cruises, dinners at the Top of the Hub, Blue Man Group outings, comedy club shows, and private dinners in the North End. Usually the night continues with ice-skating on frog pond or dessert at the Cheesecake Factory.</p>
