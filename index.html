        <p>Welcome to Delta Tau Delta at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Since our founding in 1889 the Beta Nu chapter has been a leader on campus and our brothers have gone on to be leaders around the world.</p>
        <p>Since our founding in 1889 the Beta Nu chapter has been a leader on campus and our brothers have gone on to be leaders around the world. We live in a beautiful brownstone on 416 Beacon St. where you will find a house full of dedicated, hard-working brothers. We are a diverse brotherhood hailing from all different parts of the country and represent a broad range of interests spanning all academic disciplines as well as leadership in both clubs and athletics. </p>
        <p>Our house boasts a roofdeck, study room, library, music room, workout room, six-car garage, laundry facilities, 72" HDTV hooked up to a 20 TB server, pool table, music room, and Ken Koga, our award-winning chef of over 15 years.</p>
        <p>We live by the motto "Work hard, play hard". Work hard, because we excel in academics, leadership, and service to others. Brothers are committed to academic success and take on leadership roles on campus. Play hard, because we understand that there is more to life than classes and problem sets. Our social program is known as one of Boston’s best and events range from retreats to formal cocktail parties to larger, schoolwide parties. The Delt house is a place to study and learn, a place to laugh and party, and a place to call home.</p>
        <p>The bonds of brotherhood fostered here last a lifetime and span an impressive list of alumni successful everywhere from Silicon Valley startups to the boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies. I invite you to explore our website and learn more about our chapter.</p>
        <p>I invite you to explore our website and learn more about our chapter.</p>

Our academics are of high importance and we’re proud to harbor highly talented and intelligent brothers who go on to become the greatest they can be. With brothers who span across 12 different majors, Delta Tau Delta is a diverse group of intellects that know how to take their work seriously.</p>

A library of course content, notes, and texts have been accumulated over the decades. These allow every brother a glimpse into how past brothers have succeeded academically during their time here at MIT. Our Course Library also contains the schedules of past brothers and suggestions by graduated seniors who would like to pass on their own personal skills to all present and future brothers. </p>

Brothers are held to high academic standards, and are encouraged to take full advantage of the expertise of upperclassmen who have recently completed similar coursework.</p>

Each party has a theme that makes for a great time. Beach party, Toga, Grog, Graveyard, and Goldfish are some of the best parties in Boston. Don’t just take our word for it - ask around and you’ll hear stories. These parties are where true college memories are created. Dress to theme and don’t miss out.</p>

                          <p>This is where we get fancy. Once in a while we host an invite-only cocktail party on our beautiful roof deck. They are more relaxing and quaint than the bigger parties, but debatably more fun. We hire a live Berklee jazz band to truly set the mood. Shirt and tie are mandatory for guys, and dresses mandatory for girls.</p>

                          <p>Mixers are smaller parties with a single sorority. Delts have great relationships with sororities from MIT and other schools throughout Boston. To keep these relations up, we host a variety of sorority mixers each semester, each with a different feel, set-up, and theme. We use mixers to get to know the girls more personally.</p>

                          <p>Formal is another place where we get fancy. Once a semester, we spare no expense on Formal. Examples of past Formals are harbor cruises, dinners at the Top of the Hub, Blue Man Group outings, comedy club shows, and private dinners in the North End. Usually the night continues with ice-skating on frog pond or dessert at the Cheesecake Factory.</p>
